Annotations: 

* skip : skips the test you want to ignore from the execution 

(example : 

test.skip ('has title', async ({page})=> {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});   )


* only: executes the only one particular test you want to run


(example : 

test.only ('has title', async ({page})=> {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});   )
